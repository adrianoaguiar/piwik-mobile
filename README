Description
===========     
Piwik is a downloadable, open source (GPL licensed) real time web analytics 
software program.  It provides you with detailed reports on your website 
visitors: the search engines and keywords they used, the language they speak,
your popular pages... and so much more. 

Piwik aims to be an open source alternative to Google Analytics. 

These reports are accessible by using this mobile client.
